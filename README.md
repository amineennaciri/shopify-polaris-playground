# Shopify Polaris Playground

Seeing how the UI would look and interact with it without having to spin up a starter template and a stable internet connection eventually became a necessity so I could, even when I'm travelling, create UIs and see how it would actually _feel_ when the app is finally built. This also meant creating mocks and MVPs offline became viable.

The repo is directly compatible with my [Next.js / Prisma ORM Starter Template](https://github.com/kinngh/shopify-nextjs-prisma-app). You can directly drag/drop `pages/` with the exception of `pages/_app.js`.

Happy `npm run build`ing!
